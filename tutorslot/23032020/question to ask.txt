We can use github to make a website (E.g. abc1211.github.io). But,
	
	How can i decide which html file is the page i can see
	when someone entered the website link stated above?
	
	If inside my repository, there are multiple folder inside,
	is it possible for me to setup links which connect to the
	other html file in the same repository?
	(I will make a drawing in JPG for you to understand better)
	
	What is master branch and how these branches works?

	How to make a good git commit massage (how you usually do?)

	Any good practice which you think you should have done
	what i mean here is when you learn more, your html file will
	become more and more complicated. What practice you would 
	suggest to make things clear?
